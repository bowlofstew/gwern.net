# Statistics

- "Often, I must calculate otherwise than I think. That is called diplomacy."
- Surprising linear models work at all, when they are the worst functional language ever: only operator \*, _n_ variables, _n_ assignments, & output=sum.
- When critiquing a paper, go for the jugular: any part with the words "presumably", "obviously", "past research", or "studies show".
- Tip: try to read the appendixes of research papers as well. Surprisingly often big results, not just caveats & flaws, will be buried in them
- There's always someone who can make a perpetual motion machine complicated enough that you, personally, can't figure it out.
- "Remember, citizens, fulltext is our first line of defense against science journalism!"

    - We can sleep soundly because rough men stand ready with blogs willing to do violence to papers on our behalf.
- When does measurement error matter? If you can't write "X correlates with Y" as "X correlates with scribbled survey asking about Y" without qualm.
- The use of confidence intervals rather than _p_-values is a clear improvement; it makes our difficulties vanish like smoke in a fog.
- _p_-value testing is pretty weird, but with multiple correction, it gets even weirder: the more you measure & model, the less you know.
- Power vs error vs sample size: painful tradeoff of statistics. Sins of omission, commission, & risk aversion - painful tradeoff of life?
- Not doing power analysis with informative priors is searching a haystack of unknown size for a needle which probably isn't there.
- Power analysis: if there is enough light to find the needles in the haystack; variance component analysis: if there are any needles at all.
- It'd be nice if people cared about systematic vs sampling error, Bayesian methods, informative priors & design more than once every 4 years.
- Remember: _p_-values are not posterior probabilities are not effect sizes are not utilities are not profits are not decisions.
- All analyses are ultimately decision analyses. We can ignore that for convenience, but we must never forget that.
- Our beliefs are continuous, but our actions discrete. This leads to analysis paralysis; can one execute wholeheartedly on +EV actions with _P_=1% just as well as when _P_=99%?
- Beware geeks bearing percents.
- To mine for forgotten gold in a field, look for its most austere & mathematical subfield - mathematicians are terrible at marketing.
- We will know deep learning has succeeded not when we anthropomorphize machines, but when we unanthropomorphize humans.

## Biology

- Whenever I feel maybe the FDA and big blind clinical trials are unnecessary, I go read Longecity threads until the feeling passes.
- Paleo? Atkins? Low-carb? Mediterranean? Maybe it is time to step back and ask: what should be the epistemology of food?
- Every normal man must be tempted now & then to sharpen knives, hoist a black flag, and run amok, shouting "No causation without randomization!"
- If you consider them in terms of QALYs lost, school is at least as harmful to your health as smoking, and far more expensive.
- [Paul Krugman notes](http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/ricardo.htm "Ricardo's Difficult Idea") you can look like an insane raving loon just reciting economics textbook contents in a loud voice; likewise, behavioral genetics.
- Some ask if behavioral genetics has made me nihilistic and feeling all is futile. But I have to believe in free will - my whole family does.

# Technology
## Programming

- The soul of modern man is so fallen & mutilated that he can feel despair only when trapped in dependency hell.
- One programmer's dependency solution is another's version conflict.
- Whether to check preconditions before a loop, or after: this is to define sanity and insanity.
- Programmers' chairs and keyboards cause RSIs of the body; but what RSIs of the mind?
- Will a just & merciful developer condemn good programs to bad smartphones?
- We have abstracted away from `for` loops over arrays; but what idiom will abstract away the loops of our lives?
- Backups are confronting one's fallibility & the transience of the world; we should not be surprised so few can do it.
- When was the last time you saw Americans worry about Indians? A lesson there. But don't ask an Indian developer what, ask an American.
- The pre-Internet PC was the real Wild West: a lone programmer and his compiler against hordes of quandaries.
- A pause on my keyboard for thought - and how peaceful it must be in the CPU, as the nanoseconds slowly tick by...
- "Bugs in working code are moments for reflection: how much we take on faith, because it *seems* to work!"
- "Helping newbies requires an active memory - of all the times we ourselves failed to read the fucking manual."
- Is programming Christian or Buddhist? Ask yourself how many of your programs have the [Three Marks](!Wikipedia "Three marks of existence"): _[anitya](!Wikipedia)_, _[anattā](!Wikipedia)_, & _[dukkha](!Wikipedia)_.
- "Once a program has taken on a definite form, it does not lose it until deletion."
- How can we fear machines will separate humans when even in their source code, we can read the stamp of personality & style?
- "Data, and the formats by which data are communicated, inevitably create a system permeated by illusions."
- "A truck driver may drive for 20 years without ever improving; it must be confessed that many programmers do little better."
- "Anyone satisfied by last year's code is not learning enough."
- "I do not like this algorithm/language/tool." "Why?" "I am not up to it." - anyone, ever?
- "The Internet is embarrassed by the browser."
- "The HTML page is a stark data format: everywhere it goes, there is duplication of process. It is perfect for hiding information."
- There is but one constant in every program; and it is `[see VM table entry 0x000007FEFC831010 ~> 0x00885ED010 ~> faulting in page...]`
- When you become frustrated with computers, please remember they are only cleverly arranged sand. (When you become frustrated with people...)
- "Uproot your functions from their ground and the dangling roots will be seen. More functions!"
- "I think there is a world market for maybe five computers - Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Baidu."
- The summer garbage - / the sole remnant of many / bright engineers' dreams
- Like in security, the worst possible state for a power cord or USB cable is *half* working.

### Languages

- To test whether a language despises its users, merely see whether `if (a = 1) {...}` is valid.
- Web browser developers are condemned to reinvent the OS, poorly. What is to be done about this? What could ever have been done about this?
- Mozilla now has its own community, browser, cloud, language, userland, and in a final concession to the obvious - Firefox OS!
- C, C#, Go, R, Rust: are these unsearchable names testimony to some feet of clay, or testaments to monstrous egos?
- "Haskellers knows the type of everything & the value of nothing." Unless they've turned on extensions, then neither
- C - fast and efficient and for when you don't have enough memory to remember things like why you don't want to use C.
- "C programmers stay sane by imagining that all the other insecure buggy programs are thanks to avoidable unrepresentative reasons."
- We have made an AI breakthrough! With Prolog, we have created the intelligence of a 2-year-old child: "No. No. No. No."
- "Creating a new good programming language is so difficult it tends to be only fools who try."
- "Just as winds preserve seas from stagnation, so also corruption in languages is the result of prolonged calm."
- "That code is ill-written of which one must repent; as long as the PHP bears no evil fruit, the fool thinks it sweet as honey."
- Single-paradigm languages are admirable for pushing until it breaks - or doesn't!; cf Einstein & Brownian motion; Columbus & 'spherical Earth'

## Bitcoin

- If you find yourself surprised by man or market, remember you have learned as much about your own thinking as them: revelation comes in twos.
- Bitcoin involves no new primitives or fancy proofs; perhaps cryptographers should all along have been studying sociology, not mathematics.
- The horror of Bitcoin: money really is a social construct! & not always by nice-smelling well-groomed people in sharp suits.
- A modest proposal: end tenure for computer security researchers. Given the status quo, if they're not rich, they can't be any good.
- "What is the price of two satoshis - one copper coin? But not a single satoshi can fall to fees without your Eternal Blockchain knowing it."
- The bravery of innovators: what sustained Satoshi during those lonely days in 2009 when no one cared enough even to attack Bitcoin?
- One weird philosophy trick for analysis! Imagine worlds where X failed: "Sure Bitcoin died: a deflationary currency requiring ever more waste?"
- Let us hope Karpeles will not be the Alcibiades of Bitcoin.
- The optimal number of double-spends is not zero.
- DPR was a genius until he was a fool & a knave; Satoshi was a genius until...?

### Darknet Markets

- "Ulbricht, Ulbricht, Ulbricht! A million coins were not enough for Ulbricht!"
- We criticize Ulbricht for not knowing when to quit & enjoy life; but what are we ourselves refusing to quit?
- Everything looks permanent until its secret is known. For all too many things, the beginning of fear is the beginning of knowledge.
- "A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care; this every student of the OP SECurity knows."
- Modest proposal: let's abandon the term "OPSEC". Instead, let us refer to the mistakes of Ulbricht, Benthall, MDpro, etc as "OOPSEC".
- Is crypto-libertarianism self-undermining? Can we handle the sausage factory of the darknet markets?
- When a centralized escrow market claims 1% commissions, it should append an asterisk: "and a one-time 100% fee if hacked or shut down".
- Multisig vs centralized escrow: proof that convenience is a drug faster & more addictive than the finest heroin.
- Decentralized Bitcoin markets are the future of darknet markets - and I fear always will be.
- Lust for lucre is the root of all evil? Alert the theologians: the number of centralized darknet markets is an index of Satanic activity!

# Misc

General:

- How would the world look any different than it does now if X *were* true?
- "Ricardo's theorem is the pons asinorum of economics": it always seems to be employed by asses with oddly high salaries.
- To learn to build sandcastles on the beach is to learn to live and die an atheist.
- Good results follow good intentions even as the rain follows the plow.
- "Neo, what if I told you... *everything you knew was correct*?" (That would be the biggest disappointment ever.)
- At times, tolerance can be the most radical of positions to take; just watch when a weak group gains power.
- "Reading a flame war: and all you people must once have been little children, who smiled of a summer day."
- Imagine a world where the just world and fundamental attribution bias were correct, and karma existed. Wouldn't that be unspeakably tragic?
- War seeks to mold physical conditions as one wishes; art seeks to mold minds as one wishes. Both are based on deception.
- Art is often hatred: it shows the past, or future, or far-away but never the present moment. Anti-art: a TV & camera showing the viewer.
- The "fallacy of gray" or the "fallacy of grey"? My suggestion "the fallacy of græy" was rejected without, I thought, proper consideration.
- If pigs were smart enough to worry: "the humans neither love nor hate you, but you are made of tasty bacon they can use for something else."
- On genetic engineering and AI risk, optimist: "we can't afford to worry about risks with survivors"; pessimist: "we can't afford worry about risks *without* survivors".
- I have made progress in my meditations: yesterday I told myself one truth, and only nine lies.
- Blackmail is a rent on hypocrisy, either personal or societal.
- RCTs : traditional Western medicine :: Nixon recordings : presidents :: DNA testing : courts :: priest abuse : Catholic Church :: cellphones/body cameras : police :: Wikileaks : geopolitics :: Snowden : computer security
- Optimists: everything selected to be as efficient as is possible to achieve; pessimists: everything is selected to be as terrible as is possible to get away with.

# Meta

- An aphorism is an algorithm, of we know not what input, we know not what output.
- "It is easier to write an incorrect epigram than understand a correct one."
- Voltaire's Third Law: for every aphorism, there is an equal and opposite anti-aphorism
- The epigram is a compressed, golfed, idea, with all the virtues - and sins - of golfed code.
- If we measure the entropy of epigrams by how many people understand them, who is the `gzip` of epigrams? The `xz`? (...the ZPAQ...?)
- Remember! Most strings are incompressible, most reals uncomputable, most theorems unprovable, most programs undecidable.
- Should languages support the writer's convenience or the reader's understanding? Frame it as a status debate, and all becomes clear.
- Fear not known but unknown propaganda; I have the utmost respect for _Pravda_s - how else will you know what to not believe?
- Writing down your ideas takes 90% of the time; debugging code takes another 90% of the time; rewriting takes the third 90% of the time...
- A day with nothing unusual is an unusual day. Fiction writers & GANs must include the improbable to be probable. Spend shrewdly surprisal.
