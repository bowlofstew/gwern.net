In February 2014, the Bitcoin exchange site [MtGox](!Wikipedia) began collapsing due to an unclear mix of mismanagement, theft, and hacking. The collapse was widely discussed since MtGox was one of the first & oldest operating Bitcoin exchanges (founded by Jed McCaleb in July 2010), and had once been the leading exchange. Many comments on the matter were gibes at the Bitcoin community for using a "site for trading playing cards", a reference to the site's supposed origins as a _[Magic: The Gathering](!Wikipedia)_ trading card game site: these comments irritated me as they were an irrelevant [genetic fallacy](!Wikipedia) (its origins said nothing about whether it was a secure exchange or not, especially after its sale) and were probably wrong to begin with as I had been unable to find any evidence that MtGox ever sold any _Magic_ cards.

I went back to my notes, did further research into the `mtgox.com` domain, still failed to find any convincing evidence of an operating _Magic_ exchange, and [wrote up my findings for Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mt.Gox#Possible_citogenesis_concerning_whether_MtGox_ever_hosted_an_MtG_trading_site) (reasoning that if I could correct the record on Wikipedia, the correction would eventually percolate out to the rest of the world). Then, because I had found a number of emails for McCaleb, I thought I might as well dot my i-s and cross my t-s and run my findings by McCaleb himself - he would know, after all. To [my surprise](http://predictionbook.com/predictions/24016 "McCaleb will confirm MtGox never actually sold Magic cards: 85%"), he instead confirmed that the origin story was partially true.

Below are the full emails for the record.

Initial request (subject: "Mtgox.com: did it ever actually sell Magic cards? comment requested"):

    On Wikipedia, we are discussing the accuracy of the universally-made
    claim that your Mtgox.com sold Magic cards before it was a Bitcoin
    exchange:

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mt.Gox#Possible_citogenesis_concerning_whether_MtGox_ever_hosted_an_MtG_trading_site

    As the ultimate authority on what Mtgox was or was not doing in the
    years before its sale, any public statement on the issue would be
    greatly appreciated.

McCaleb:

    yes I used the domain name for a magic card trading site years before.
    but the code for the bitcoin exchange was completely different. I just
    had the domain laying around.

Reply:


    Thanks for replying, but the question was a little different: we know
    the mtgox.com domain had a landing page discussing a forthcoming Magic
    card trading site (because a 2007 page is in the Internet Archive),
    but we can't find any evidence that there was any
    actual trading going on. Did anyone ever actually trade card for card
    or money for card on Mtgox.com?

    yeah they did

Request for clarification:

    Huh - I'm surprised since the anti-card case seemed strong; but if you
    say it, it must be true.

    Could you give some details on this, for posterity?

    When did the card part open up, and when did you close it? What
    exactly did it do? (Some people suggested it was for not physical
    cards but something to do with the _Magic: The Gathering Online_
    software; ie, Mtgox is not short for "'Magic The Gathering' online
    exchange" but "'Magic The Gathering Online' exchange".) How many
    people used it and how much business was there? Why did you decide to
    close it?

McCaleb:

    > When did the card part open up, and when did you close it?

    Probably around 2006? It was only up for 3 months maybe.

    > What

    Yes it was for the online version of magic. It allowed cards to be
    bought and sold like stocks.

    > How many

    > close it?

    idk not that many. It could have gotten bigger if I had put more time
    into it. but ultimately it wasn't worth my time.

    I believe you. A Magic exchange doesn't seem like it would have much
    in common with a cryptocurrency codebase. And in any case, early Mtgox
    didn't seem like it'd been worked on for over 4 years - for example,
    using MD5 for passwords was not the sign of a mature high-quality
    implementation. (It also amuses me to see people claim that you must
    secretly be Satoshi Nakamoto - as if Satoshi would ever endanger his
    users by using MD5 for anything...)

    Only 3 months would explain why the IA didn't get a snapshot of the
    homepage when it was operating, yeah. (Incidentally, I think your year
    is off: the snapshot in September 2007
    https://web.archive.org/web/20070918015632/http://mtgox.com/ describe
    it as forthcoming, so maybe Oct-Dec 2007?)

    Ah. No wonder I couldn't find anyone discussing the physical cards
    they'd bought off Mtgox.com! It really wasn't physical cards at all.

    Fair enough. Can't argue with the results.

    I think that answers most of my questions, so I'll forward these
    emails to the relevant Wikimedia Foundation mailing list or put them
    up somewhere maybe, and update the Wikipedia article. Maybe something
    like this:

    I think that covers everything important while not being misleading or
    discussing trivia.

At this point, I decided I had taken up enough of his time and could write a short version of the true events for the Wikipedia article.
