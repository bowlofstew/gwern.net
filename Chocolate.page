# Dark chocolate
## Unflavored

- Venchi: Venichi Biologico 70% Cacao dark chocolate; cacao fino aromatico Criollo Blanco e nacional Amendolado; 70g; 70%; cocoa, sugar cane, cocoa butter; Ecuador ~$10 http://www.venchi.com/uk/organic-blend-dark-chocolate-bar-70-cocoa.html

    perfectly balanced and unbitter dark chocolate. (The organic ad copy is over the top, though.)

- Guido Gobino: Dark Chocolate Bar Extra Bitter Blend; $5?; 63%; 55g; cocoa, cane sugar, cocoa butter 3 stars

    Despite the name, mild, pleasant, inoffensive. Almost a bit like milk chocolate.
- Guido Gobino: Dark Chocolate Bar Blend; 70%; $5?; 55g; cocoa cane sugar, cocoa butter 2.5 stars

    Very similar to the 63%, but the extra 7% somehow comes with a slightly sour aftertaste reminiscent of the distinct sourness of Hershey milk chocolate, making it somewhat worse.
- Valrhona: Noir Alpaco, Floral and Oaky; Ecuador; 66%; 70g; $6.95; cocoa, sugar, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, vanilla extract 4 stars https://www.chocosphere.com/default/brand/t-z/valrhona/alpaco-bar.html

>  The majority of the cacao used for Alpaco (66% Cocoa) comes from the Ecuadorian Arriba bean. It combines strength and sophistication, offering delicate floral aromas of jasmine and orange blossom, intimately and intricately intertwined with deep cacao notes.

    One of the first I've tried using vanilla, I think it makes a big difference. The inoffensive dark chocolate aspect of the Guido Gobino is here augmented by the, yes, 'floral and oaky' overtones and the vanilla.
- Pralus: Djakarta: 75%; 100g; $8.35?; cocoa, sugar, cocoa butter, soy lecithin 3 stars https://www.chocosphere.com/default/brand/j-p/pralus/djakarta-bar.html

    >  Fresh and subtle, woody aroma with wild mushrooms, slightly acid and long on the palate. Cocoa origin: Indonesia. 75% Cocoa, 100g/3.5oz.

    Very similar to the Guido Gobino 70% but with a more tolerable bitterness.
- Michel Cluizel; Plantation Mokaya; 70g; 66%; Mexico; cocoa, cane sugar, cocoa butter, Bourbon vanilla pod $6.7 https://www.chocosphere.com/default/brand/j-p/michel-cluizel/dark-mokaya-bar.html 3 stars

    > Crafted from cacao grown on the Mokaya plantation in the Mexican state of Chiapas, this chocolate perpetuates the local age-old tradition of producing a unique chocolate taste. First to burst into the mouth, the powerful notes of cocoa and fruits which then transition into dried fruit flavors. Certified organic by Arigculture Biologique.

    Ordinary.
- Domori: Il Blend 70% dark chocolate. 70%, $4.45, 25g, cocoa mass, cane sugar https://www.chocosphere.com/default/blend-line-il-blend-bar.html 3 stars

    > "Il Blend" is the archetype of chocolate. Sweet, round, and balanced in flavor, thanks to Criollo, the source of excellence of this formula. A combination of fine plants, fermentation technique, and method of processing. Extremely long persistence and extraordinary balance. Also, the new "Il Blend" bar is of reduced thickness to improve the tasting experience
- Domori: Il Blend 100% dark chocolate. 100%, $4.45; 25g, cocoa mass/ 1 star  https://www.chocosphere.com/default/blend-line-il-100-bar-25g.html

    > The same blend of cacao as in the "Il Blend" chocolate bar but with no added sugar. Pure and unadulterated. A bold and very palatable tasting experience.

    Chalky, bitter, dry, inedible. This tastes exactly like dark baking chocolate or dark cocoa powder eaten straight, and is a reminder of why 'purity' is an _ignis fatuus_ of chocolate. 100% is the reductio ad absurdum of the belief that higher cacao percentage is better. It is bizarre that Domori sells it, and more bizarre that anyone buys it (I didn't, it was part of the subscription). If it was being sold as baking chocolate, that would be one thing, but Domori intends this for eating, with the box saying "The long-lasting flavor and extraordinary balance of this product make for a unique sensory experience." Well, I can agree that the 'long-lasting flavor' does indeed 'make for a unique sensory experience' - and not one I intend to repeat. Even eating a roasted cocoa bean is more pleasant. May be usable as a substitute for powder or for baking.

Domori: Arriba Ecuador, 70%, 25g; cocoa mass, cane sugar 3
> features hazelnut, banana and citrus notes. Fresh and mellow.
Domori: Cacao Criollo Puertofino, 70%, 25g, cocoa mass, cane sugar 3
> It has notes of caramel, tobacco, walnuts, papaya, brushwood, mushrooms, and dates.
Domori: Teyuna Columbia, 70%, 25g, cocoa mass, cane sugar 3
> Features cashew and honey notes and a sweet, long-lasting flavor.
Nutty aftertaste
Domori: Cacao Criollo Guasare, 70%, 25g, cacao mass, cane sugar 2.5
> The father of all Criollos. It is an ancient cacao with notes of white flowers, toffee, cream, and extraordinary elegance.
Flat, somewhat bitter, with coffee overtones.
Domori: Cacao Criollo Puertomar, 75%, 25g, cocoa mass, cane sugar 2
> Puertomar has notes of cream, spices, almonds and cherry jam with excellent smoothness and sweetness.
Bitter and unpleasantly sour.

- Cacao Prieto: 72%, Dominican Republic; 85g; cacao, cane sugar; 3 stars $7.95 https://www.chocosphere.com/default/brand/a-c/cacao-prieto/cprt-72-bar-85g.html

    > Handcrafted from single origin, Dominican cacao, the original 72% criollo bar, as with the rest of the criollo line, is produced from some of the oldest and finest criollo cacao strains in the DR. Roasted in small batches this chocolate bar contains notes of berry, and undertones of burgundy and oak, with an earthy richness that showcases the beautiful terroir of this chocolate.

    Most striking part of flavor is the complex semi-sour vanilla-like aftertaste. Unsure I like it, but may serve as an example of how a single-origin chocolate can have much more distinctiveness than expected.
- Bonnat: Vale do Juliana Bresil dark chocolate, 75%; $12.25 Brazil; cocoa beans, cocoa butter, sugar; 100g 3.5 stars https://www.chocosphere.com/default/juliana-75-dark-chocolate-bar.html

    >  The Juliana Plantation is located in the heart of the protected area of Pratigi. For twenty years, farmers have embarked on a rigorous selection of the best cacao, to offer the quality that has made the Brazilian bean a reference point for others. The planters follow the advanced social model initiated by Norberto Odebrecht and is a dazzling example of economic justice. This chocolate will impart the fine fruit flavors of Brazil and the spirit of the people who work there.

    Moist and sweet with a slight floral aftertaste.

- [Pura Delizia](http://puradelizia.it/): 73%, Venezuela, 100g; $8.95 https://www.chocosphere.com/default/brand/j-p/pura-delizia/pdza-venezuela-bar-100g.html ; cocoa beans, cane sugar, cocoa butter, soy lecithin

    >  The magic of chocolate, the excellence of prime beans, and heady spicy notes: a whole world in a single bar. With 73% of single origin cocoa painstakingly selected on the plantations of Venezuela to give a special aroma to the chocolate.
- Pura Delizia: 65%, Dominican Republic, 100g, $8.95 https://www.chocosphere.com/default/brand/j-p/pura-delizia/pdza-domrep-bar-100g.html cocoa beans, cane sugar, cocoa butter, soy lecithin. 2 stars

    >  A delicious single origin, made with Trinitario cocoa beans from the Dominican Republic. Bursting with tobacco flavors and an underlying note of roasted almonds.

    Harsher and more bitter than the Vietnam Pura Delizia, 'tobacco' may be more apt than 'coffee'.
- Pura Delizia: 75%, Vietnam, 100g; $8.95 https://www.chocosphere.com/default/brand/j-p/pura-delizia/pdza-vietnam-bar-100g.html ; cocoa beans, cane sugar, cocoa butter, soy lecithin. 3 stars

    >  An explosion of cocoa fragrance, enriched with citrus and wood notes. A special chocolate with a great deal of character.

    Moist chewy texture; initial peppery coffee, with some sourness mixed in.
- Kah Kow: Organic Dark Chocolate 70%, Dominican Republic, 50g, $5.50 https://www.chocosphere.com/default/brand/j-p/kah-kow/70-bar-50g.html, Cocoa liquor, cane sugar, cocoa butter, vanilla, soy lecithin. 4 stars

    >  Kah Kow Dark 70% bar. This amazing bean to bar dark chocolate has beautiful notes of red fruits and prunes; followed by the intense flavors of roasted coffee and cacao. There is an elegant lingering note of subtle bitterness and a long lasting licorice finish. Kah Kow chocolates are Rainforest Certified, Agriculture Bio UE/UE, USDA Organic, Dominican Republic Organic, Control IMO.
    > ...The initial attack displays beautiful note of red fruits and prunes; followed by intense flavors of roasted coffee and cacao, ending with an elegant subtle bitterness and a long lasting licorice relish.

    Sweet, flowery
- Kah Kow, Chocolate de Referencia: 55%, Dominican Republic, 50g, $5.50 https://www.chocosphere.com/default/brand/j-p/kah-kow/55-bar-50g.html ; Cocoa liquor, cane sugar, cocoa butter, vanilla, soy lecithin

    > This amazing bean to bar dark chocolate has a unique balance of ingredients. This recipe reveals an initial hint of acidic Caribbean fruits, followed by an alluring sweetness. This bar ends with a note of licorice and dried figs. Kah Kow chocolates are Rainforest Certified, Agriculture Bio UE/UE, USDA Organic, Dominican Republic Organic, Control IMO
    > ...The unique balance of ingredients in this recipe reveals an initial slight hint of acidulous Caribbean fruits, then some sweetness arises, ending on a note of licorice and dried figs.

    Highly sweet with a slight sour/acidity, but everything mostly drowned out by the sweetness.
- Kah Kow, Organic Extra Dark Chocolate: 82%, Dominican Republic, 50g, $5.50 https://www.chocosphere.com/default/brand/j-p/kah-kow/82-bar-50g.html

    > This amazing bean to bar dark chocolate has beautiful notes of red fruits and prunes; followed by the intense flavors of roasted coffee and cacao. There is an elegant lingering note of subtle bitterness and a long lasting licorice finish. Kah Kow chocolates are Rainforest Certified, Agriculture Bio UE/UE, USDA Organic, Dominican Republic Organic, Control IMO
    > ...Its smell reminds us of the flavorful aromas of the roasted nuts, which slowly give place to the scent of Green moss. In the mouth a typical relish of cocoa arises powerfully, then licorice; it finishes with an elegant dry bitter note.

## Flavored


- Dolfin: Chocolat Noir, Oranges Ameres D'Espagne; 30g; $2.50; coca mass (60%), sugar, orange (5%), cocoa butter, soy lecithin, natural orange flavor, natural vanilla. Dark chocolate with bitter orange. https://www.chocosphere.com/default/brand/d-i/dolfin/dolfin-chocolat-noir-oranges-ameres-d-espagne-mini-bar-30g.html 3 stars

    > 60% cacao. Dark chocolate harmoniously blended with the zingy freshness of Seville oranges.

    Surprisingly weak on the orange; the orange is included as little peel-chunks, which while intense flavored, can't contribute much to the overall flavor.
- Ethereal Confections: Inclusion chocolate bar; 64g; $7.50; cacao beans (66%), cane juice, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, candied ginger, candied orange pell, coriander. Dark chocolate topped with coriander, candied orange peel & ginger. http://www.etherealconfections.com/inclusion-bar-ginger-orange.html 5 stars

    This sounds like a bizarre combination of ingredients, and my first dubious thought looking at the label was "no wonder this didn't sell and was put in my bargain bag" - candied orange is a reasonable combination with dark chocolate, but ginger is questionable (not used too much outside of gingerbread men and ginger snaps because it's such an overwhelming flavor) and *coriander*? That's a spice I use frequently in cooking for carrots, but I couldn't imagine why it would be paired with dark chocolate, much less embedded as chunks on the top of a dark chocolate bar. But to my surprise, it's extremely tasty! As you bite in, you savor the aroma and taste of the ginger, which mixes with the spiciness of the coriander followed by the orange making itself known and it all being embedded in a rising dark chocolate flavor, for a highly effective combination. I couldn't help myself and finished the whole bar in an hour. This combo probably isn't for everyone but it sure worked for me.
- Taza Chocolate: Dark chocolate Mexicano Coffee; 77g; $4.50; cacao beans (55%), cane sugar, coffee beans 4 stars

    Adopting a coarse chocolate texture with visible sugar crystals, the coffee flavoring turns out to combine harmoniously with the dark chocolate for a hearty & savory taste. While I normally hate anything coffee-flavored, I liked this and ate both disks quickly.
- Pacari: Chile (chili peppers & spices); 50g; $4.49; Ecuador; cacao mass, can sugar, cacao butter, sunflower lecithin, chili, coriander, salt; 60% https://www.chocosphere.com/default/pcri-merken-spice-bar-cs.html 1 star

    >  Pacari Single-Origin Chili Spice Bar .For those who like their chocolate picante, but want more than just fire, this bar combines rich dark organic chocolate with Merken, a chili spice traditionally used by the indigenous Mapuche people of Chile. It gives the heat of chili but with a spicy, smoky flavor.

    The dark chocolate seemed to taste unremarkable, and the chili aftertaste destroyed my ability to taste anything. Did not like at all.

# Milk chocolate

- Bahlsen: Choco Leibniz (butter biscuits covered with milk chocolate); 125g; $3 https://www.chocosphere.com/default/blsn-butter-milk.html

    > A lavish layer of European milk chocolate tops this original all-butter biscuit. Choco Leibniz proudly displays its name in chocolate, lest the bliss of eating it makes you forget.

    Biscuit here means a pasty-like shortbread, the sort of crispier quasi-bread you see a lot of in sweets and treats for children. This is a cut above that sort of stuff, and though it's just milk chocolate, it's a pleasant pairing.

# Miscellaneous

- Domori: cubetti d'arancia (candied orange covered with dark chocolate); 50g; $4; candied orange peels, cocoa 72%; 2 stars

    The orange filling was tasteless, leaving the dark chocolate to do all the work, and there was much less dark chocolate.
- Domori: Fave di cacao, intere tostate e sgusciate (whole shelled and roasted cocoa beans); 100g; $19.95? https://www.chocosphere.com/default/brand/d-i/domori/dm-kashaya-fave-di-cacao-criollo.html

    I was not sure how one uses whole roasted cocoa beans. I tried eating one and while it had an interesting flavor which combined nuttiness with chocolate and a coffee-like aroma, it was not that enjoyable. Apparently they can be ground up into nibs and turned into cocoa liquor, which can be used in various kinds of baking or to make regular chocolate or to make Mayan-style hot chocolate. I wound up grinding them in a food processor (I overdid the grinding and the powder became hard and stuck together), followed by boiling it in 5 cups of whole milk for ~10 minutes and steeping for an hour. With some tablespoons of sugar, plus vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, and red pepper, it was... OK? Somewhat gritty but tasted a lot like what I would expect making hot chocolate from dark cocoa powder would be like.
- Kane Candy: Marbled Chocolate Heart Cups, includes chocolate decorating curls (4 cups holding ~17g each); intended for serving chocolate or fruits or desserts in. I have no particular use for them.

Overall lessons learned:

1. I tend to prefer dark chocolates with 60-80% cocoa. Less, and it starts to become too sweet or, if milk chocolate, too sour (especially Hershey's). More, and it becomes horrible, culminating in 100% cacao which is not fit to eat. Vanilla is a good addition.
2. Single-origin bars really do taste distinct and difference and have more complicated flavors. Is it worth the premium? Unsure. Often the complication is through adding more unpleasant flavors. More flavors != better: they have to synergize.
3. I enjoy hazelnuts more than I thought
3. Dark chocolate on its own is nice, but is also boring. The tastiest chocolates are a combination - the best bar of them all was the coriander+ginger+chocolate bar.
4. The Chocosphere monthly subscription was not a ripoff, but it was more expensive than the bargain-basement, especially since it required multiple costly shipments. I would have been better off sinking the same money into a single big order of everything in the Chocosphere bargain-basement (especially since dark chocolate keeps for a long time).
5. the cost per dose of dark chocolate is not convincing. I like dark chocolate as much as I like high-quality tea, but whereas a \$9 dark chocolate bar might weight 100g and I get perhaps 5 snacks out of it (at 20g a piece, anything less is unsatisfying), \$9 could *also* buy me 50g of good tea - and I only need ~1g of tea per mug (and might get a second mug out of it if it's a tea that resteeps well). So the tea is >5x more cost-effective, while the dark chocolate is roughly on par with mead for costliness. To compete, the dark chocolate bar needs to be around \$0.9 instead or ~\$10/kg; this is a difficult price to reach (for example, the 70% Kah Kow I rated 4 stars is available at \$11/0.5kg  https://www.chocosphere.com/default/category/chef/blocks/70-bloc-500g.html which is close - but only if I buy at least 12 of them or \$132. Other blocks are more expensive: https://www.chocosphere.com/default/category/chef/blocks.html)

Dagoba mint:2 stars
dark chocolate (59%), mint, and rosemary essence 56g, cacao beans, cane sugar, cacao butter, soy lecithin, peppermint oil, rosemary oil, milk;
an ordinary dark chocolate flavored with mint and a disturbing hint of rosemary. As much as I like rosemary in my cooking and my garden, the combination does not work. The rosemary comes off as... sour? Wrong? Eating three bars of this did not change my mind. The flavor doesn't work any more than the lavender does.

cocoa, sugar, cocoa butter, mint leaves, egg whites, vanilla, rapeseed lecithin
A bar with a single large dried mint leaf encrusted in crystallized sugar and embedded into the back, it is both striking and messy. The mint leaf is itself the mint flavoring, there is no mint oil mixed into the chocolate. The leaf is not adequate to the job because it can't cover the whole bar and the strength of a single mint leaf is not huge, so it's not as good as the Chocolove xoxox Peppermint Bar's consistent mintiness. The dark chocolate is adequate.

> Cafe-Tasse Belgian White Chocolate Bar with Rooibos tea and Vanilla. Rooibos is a caffeine-free red herbal tea grown in South Africa, known for its fruity and naturally sweet flavor. It pairs well with vanilla and Cafe Tasse's premium Belgian white chocolate.
I've given rooibos a try as a tea but didn't care for it. Combined with white chocolate, it is intriguingly malty, with little bits of solid thready rooibos adding texture.

> Latte nero is a top quality milk chocolate, where every single aromatic flavor of the cocoa is enhanced. The perfect balance between cocoa, milk and sugar makes it a unique product in its genre.
The milk chocolates were disappointing in general. They are much better than Hershey's milk chocolate as they lack the sour tang from the butyric acid that Hershey's traditionally, but I have a hard time distinguishing any of them from each other. They are tasty but bland.

> Taza Chocolate 70% Cacao Chipotle Chili Chocolate Mexicano Discs. Chipotle chiles are jalapeños that have been wood-smoked, a process that dates back to the Aztec civilization. While the Aztec used this drying method to preserve ripe chiles, today we prize chipotles for their rich, deeply smoky flavor - a flavor that makes a perfect counterpoint to the fruity, bittersweet intensity of Taza's 70% Chocolate Mexicano. With the medium-hot tingle from the chiles and the rustic texture of stone-milled dark chocolate, the Chipotle Chocolate Mexicano is a feast for all the senses. Cocoa origin: Dominican Republic. Cocoa content: 70%. USDA certified organic.

>  Taza Chocolate 70% Cacao Puro Chocolate Mexicano is the purest expression of Taza's chocolate, made from only two ingredients: single origin Dominican cacao and sustainably grown, raw cane sugar.

This minimal process lends Cacao Puro its distinctive stone ground texture and robust, wine-like flavor. Cocoa origin: Dominican Republic. Cocoa content: 70%. USDA certified organic.
