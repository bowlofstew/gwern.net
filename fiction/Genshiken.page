    Go, tell the others
    on campus, in the clubroom,
    that at Comiket -
    despite all blistering suns -
    the flowers of dreams yet bloom.

    In just this one day,
    I experienced so much!
    So how is it, then,
    That the weeks and months before
    remain dim and forgotten?

    This day in the line,
    fighting and laughing with friends,
    the world forgotten,
    I must not later forget
    when I am sorting all my goods.

    Sure that none would
    ever read his book again
    he still wrote those notes,
    sure that those thoughts were worth thought
    and would find a home some day.

    When I look upon
    the bales of abandoned books,
    I am saddened: by
    an enthusiastic pen,
    drawing for so many nights.

    Where the otaku
    have all vanished from the stairs
    and its rope linings,
    now stars pass the long night and
    papers rustle in the breeze.


    They argue harshly -
    but then, does ink hate paper?
    or paper the ink?

    Do not be misled!
    Their books are camouflage for
    the red strings of fate
    that they have shyly forged
    over the years, side by side.

    And with what shall I
    compare us?
                  A boy walking
    through the warm spring night,
    as he leaves his friends, knowing
    just how few partings remain.

    Loneliness - unknown
    until a chill pine wind blows;
    I shiver alone.
