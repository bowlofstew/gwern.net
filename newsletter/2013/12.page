This is the inaugural December issue of the `gwern.net` mailing list; you probably signed up through a link there. If you do not want to receive further monthly emails, there is an unsubscribe link at the bottom.

The purpose of this mailing list is to be a more meaningful and summarized version of the RSS feed (which lists every patch, no matter how small) overlapping with my [Changelog page](https://gwern.net/Changelog), but in a push/notification medium rather than pull.

While I was at it, I thought I would include some other material like the [links I share on Google+](https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968). Since this is the first time, I don't know if people are interested in this or if I omitted anything that people expected; feel free to email me with suggestions or feedback (I *believe* the reply-to should be set to my address, `gwern@gwern.net`, but I am not sure). Without further ado:

## Film/TV

- _Aku no Hana_: dropped after a few episodes, couldn't stand the rotoscoping
- _A Christmas Story_/_National Lampoon: Christmas Vacation_: watched with family. The former was pretty good. The latter, though, had some good jokes but was generally mediocre and strained, and a product of its time.

## Books
### Nonfiction

I reread [_Discovery of France_](http://www.amazon.com/The-Discovery-France-Historical-Geography/dp/0393333647/?tag=gwernnet-20) because I liked it so much the first time ([review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/369875300)).

- I finished _Umineko_ back in September, finished writing a review
