2015 saw two important fields continue their abrupt surge, going from strength to strength: genetics (behavioral genetics in particular) and AI.
The pace of progress was dizzying, with, it seemed, each month bringing major results to the point where it drowned out important news from other fields and made it difficult to pick just 10; for example, who has time to note a major milestone in cryonics like proof of preservation of long-term memory in _C. elegans_ when CRISPR is increasing in power on a monthly basis and researchers are offhandedly producing feats like myostatin-enhanced beagles or "micropigs" that would have been major R&D efforts just years ago?
And the flood of deep learning results has continued to the point where end-of-year roundups of major breakthroughs accidentally omit discoveries like MSR's residual networks which enable powerful neural networks with literally hundreds of layers to be trained? As [Karpathy put it](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/709465955223543808): "BatchNorm, STN, DCGAN, DRAW, soft/hard attention, char-rnn, DeepDream, NeuralStyle, TensorFlow, ResNet, AlphaGo.. a lot happened over 1 year"
Not to mention behavioral genetics' findings being repeatedly vindicated in large-scale genetic studies, confuting the critics, but also going further and making surprising new discoveries like a pervasive web of genetic correlations between intelligence and many other traits; population genetics in general is increasingly finding that there are meaningful differences between even closely related populations, indicating the important of 'soft selection sweeps' and the cumulative effect of small differences on many genes, which have lead to changes as large as domestication.
And based on just January 2016's news in both areas, it seems that 2015 will not be exceptional but marks a new normal for these two areas and we can look forward to many exciting new results consolidating & extending 2015.
