## Film/TV

Live-action:

- [_Woman in Gold_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman_in_Gold) (a mess: the dialogue and dramatic arc are so hammy and forced, and the depiction is so totally one-sided that you feel like you are watching a dull propaganda film rather than a documentary; it's not afraid to explicitly cast contemporary Austrians as Nazis, sometimes making up Nazi connections like the friendly journalist's father, and even the Supreme Court justices are depicted as kindly and listening to the protagonist's speechifying rather than being the sharp-tongued cynics they really come off as in transcripts. And it's difficult to sympathize like you're supposed to because ultimately you're being asked to root for a rich heiress suing some paintings back from a public museum in order to immediately sell them to a private collector, out of revenge or something; is she venal or vicious? You'd never know from the movie - where a meeting with the art dealer whom the paintings were sold to in real life is spun as being all about showing support for her lawyer, rather than settling on prices and possibly explaining where funding for the lawsuits came from. The movie rather baldfacedly suggests that she wants the paintings back as memories of her childhood, which is at least understandable, but then at the very end - in tiny 2 second telops so low-resolution that we had to freeze-frame them and sound out each word to see what they said on our TV - reveals that she sold them the instant she could for hundreds of millions of dollars. Yes, she donated (most of?) the funds to charity, but the kinds of charity she picked showed that she was simply buying social status and prestige.)
