## Books

Nonfiction:

- [_Epic Measures: One Doctor. Seven Billion Patients._](http://www.amazon.com/Epic-Measures-Doctor-Billion-Patients/dp/0062237500), on [Christopher Murray's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_J.L._Murray) [Global Burden of Disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_burden_of_disease)
- [_Practical Criticism_](https://archive.org/details/practicalcritici030142mbp), [I.A. Richards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I._A._Richards) (an amusing demonstration of the incompetence of most readers in showing the bizarre incomprehension of the plain meaning of many poems and the extreme inconsistency of their critical evaluations thereof, and Richards makes that point at length; still, I remain totally unconvinced by his claim that the "tinkles" poem is of any merit!)
- [_Although Of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself: A Road Trip with David Foster Wallace_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Although_of_Course_You_End_Up_Becoming_Yourself),  Lipsky 2010 ([review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1391170585))
- [_Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha_](http://www.dharmaoverground.org/dharma-wiki/-/wiki/Main/MCTB/en) (unrateable due to lack of personal experience; I was reading it because an IRC acquaintance had practiced MCTS for a while and said that the jhana descriptions were fairly accurate for him, and I'm always curious about altered states of mind. The descriptions in MCTS were interesting and left me wondering what is going on psychologically in them. That said, I am not convinced the more advanced meditation is worth the effort, or even beneficial, and MCTS doesn't make much of an effort to argue that they are. Although the concentration states sounded interesting, if I was serious about looking into altered states of minds, I would be getting back into psychedelics instead as much more repeatable and less expensive.)

## Film/TV

Live-action:

- [_The Theory of Everything_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Theory_of_Everything_\(2014_film\)) (2014 biopic movie of Stephen Hawking, focusing on his first marriage to Jane Wilde as a student until the divorce. Flaws include the standard Hollywood portrayal of geeks and some lamentably missed opportunities for explaining the ideas involved in Hawking's life-work - for example, in explaining Hawking radiation, which is probably one of the easiest and most interesting possible ideas in 20th century cosmology to explain in a few seconds for laymen, the director instead decides to cut back and forth between Hawking's lecture and an incoherent pub discussion of same. I also have to wonder if debates about God were really as central to their lives as the movie made them, as they felt shoe-horned in; physicists tend to only bring up God in a Noble Lie way, for funding.  What *is* good - perhaps even great - about the movie, is (a) the remarkable job Eddie Redmayne does in acting out the physical deterioration of Hawking, so uncannily well that my suspension of disbelief became absolute and I totally forgot that he was not really Hawking himself, and (b) the decay of the Hawkings' marriage and eventual divorce, which is an unexpected topic to focus on but made sense once I learned it was based on Jane Wilde's memoirs. I was not sure it was worth watching in the early part showing the romance, but once Hawking's ALS enters the plot, then it became gripping for me.)

Anime:

- [_Shirobako_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirobako) ([review](http://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=200297))

## Other Media

- [_XCOM: Enemy Unknown_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCOM:_Enemy_Unknown): 2012 turn-based tactical strategy (isometric 3D) game; on Steam for Linux. You kill aliens. Very heavy on the atmosphere and moody graphics, with many special effects and little cut-scenes. As a tactical strategy, it has weaknesses; units must be trained & upgraded over many missions so they are worth their weight in gold, one-shot kills are always possible, getting in the first shot is critical, and the level layout has the standard mechanism where clusters of aliens are triggered when one moves, all of which combine to force on you an extremely conservative gameplay style where you move as slowly as possible through the level with all your soldiers always in cover, lest you trigger 3 or 4 groups of aliens simultaneously and lose one or more near-irreplaceable units. It is quite an incentive to reload levels that go badly and one well-placed enemy or even-slightly-aggressive move costs you 2 or 3 elites of your squad (I didn't reload... much.) As such, the snipers level up with the greatest of ease as they do most of the killing, and they only get more overpowered when Archangel armor is developed and they can now shoot across almost entire levels without having to move! The levels themselves are not very imaginative either, with all of them boiling down to search-and-destroy in levels which are copies of each other, even the hostage-rescue and bomb-defusing missions (where the best strategy seems to be to, yes, just killing the aliens as fast as possible). Tech upgrades are doled out sparingly, so that one only gets the funnest weapons like the Ghost armor (temporary invisibility) or Blaster Launcher (rockets that go around corners) as the game is ending. (Holding Ghost armor until the end is particularly unfortunate, since it helps reduce the incentive for ultra-conservative explorations and the 4-turn limit makes it a challenge to use optimally.) I have to contrast the tactical strategy aspect of _XCOM_ unfavorably to the last game I was playing, [_Advance Wars: Dual Strike_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Wars:_Dual_Strike): units can be risked in gambits and attacks because losing them is not so devastating, the first-attacker still has a huge advantage but this makes for interesting ambushes and tactics rather than forcing passivity, and since the enemy is always in motion, you are constantly under pressure to act too. Overall, I enjoyed it, but don't feel any need to play it again.
