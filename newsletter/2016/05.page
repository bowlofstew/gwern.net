Gets around privacy & scaling problems by using, not GCTA, but [LD regression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4495769/ "'LD Score regression distinguishes confounding from polygenicity in genome-wide association studies', Bulik-Sullivan et al 2015") which only needs summary statistics. LD score regression is definitely the wave of the future. GCTA was king for a few years, but the inability to use summary data is killing it; in the modern context of a thousand different funding sources, 'medical ethics', & empire building driving countless genetic silos, a method must be able to work on just summary statistics if it's to have any real uptake and get _n_ into the hundreds of thousands.)

## Books

Nonfiction:

- [_Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr._](http://www.amazon.com/Titan-Life-John-Rockefeller-Sr/dp/1400077303), Chernow ([review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1624479337))

Fiction:

- [_Poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins_](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22403), by Gerard Manley Hopkins ([review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1643077424))
- ["CORDYCEPS: Too clever for their own good"](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868) (SF/horror humor novella on overthinking things; early chapters are best in exploring acausal & amnesiac reasoning, somewhat like _Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria_, but goes on perhaps a bit too long and explains too much)

Fanfiction:

- [_Significant Digits_](http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html) (_Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality_: sequel intended to conclude the story; more action-focused with a literary bent, and much less didactic/"author tract" and Harry-focused than _MoR_. Highly recommended for anyone who liked _MoR_.)

## Film/TV

Live-action:

- [_Father Goose_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_Goose_%28film%29) (peculiar Cary Grant WWII comedy-drama; it's unusual to see Grant cast as a misanthropic drunkard and the movie can't quite decide whether to be deadly serious or comedic, but most of the comedic beats are highly predictable)

Anime:

- [_Short Peace_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Peace) (anthology of 4 short anime; the first is a curious folk-tale-esque story of a wandering peddler who is almost improbably skilled at repair and his overnight labors at a shrine devoted to & haunted by the animist spirits of old inanimate objects - "[_tsukogami_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukumogami)". The 3D CGI is interesting but also somewhat offputting. The second takes a ukiyo-e inspired form of animation, in its initially tedious exploration of a doomed romance in Tokugawa-era Edo; this is merely the prologue to the unhappy bridge knocking over a lantern and starting a city-wide fire - one of many, historically, given that fireproofness was not one of the virtues of traditional Japanese architecture - at which point the animation kicks into high gear with some truly impressive animations of fire. Western viewers will probably be irritated by how the short assumes that one knows how city fires were fought in the pre-modern era: by empowering firefighters not with water pumps, which hardly existed, but construction equipment and large brigades of laborers given unlimited power to tear down large connected sections of buildings to form "fire-breaks".

    The third story is the most bizarre and troubling: an enormous and grotesque ogre preys on the countryside, demanding tribute of young girls to rape and eat, and when he goes after nobility, a wild bear attacks it at its home, which is not a cave but a crashed flying saucer or rocket (‽). The scenario makes little sense, and the unmistakable saucer invites an allegorical reading - perhaps the bear as Russia, the ogre as America, and the raped & murdered girls as Japan? Odd. The final short film, the eponymous "Short Peace", is the best: an engaging exploration of near-future warfare using networked soldier squads assisted by drones and robotic suits fighting an autonomous military robot, which extrapolates existing trends in the American military as being prototyped in Iraq & Afghanistan. After watching it twice, I still don't quite get some aspects of the worldbuilding like why there is apparently an ICBM underneath Tokyo or why the protagonists would try to launch it, but the action itself is memorable and worth watching.)
- [_Death Parade_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Parade) (expansion of _Death Billiards_, as an episodic series; stories remain a bit heavily focused on suicide and murder, but while the dark background story arc ultimately ends in a whimper, the main story arc ends in a very emotionally satisfying way)
