Progress in deep learning is fast, and this also illustrates the optimization potential of neural networks: they start off grossly overparameterized, but can be specialized down to much more powerful faster systems...)

What might a explicit planning over future paths for NNs look like? This is one step.)

- ["StackGAN: Text to Photo-realistic Image Synthesis with Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03242), Zhang et al 2016 (Another nice improvement to DCGANs: a pair of GANs (one for prototyping, a second for upscaling) generating sharp images at 256px. I hope they release source code - I'd like to try it out with my anime dataset from Danbooru, which earlier DCGANs couldn't cope with); ["Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.04357v1.pdf), Huang et al 2016

I'd rather see it split by intervention type, the correlation trials excluded entirely, and maybe redone as a network meta-analysis or better yet, a network SEM, since there are multiple measures of body fat and inflammation under consideration.)

- ["Liquid Haskell: Haskell as a Theorem Prover"](http://goto.ucsd.edu/~nvazou/thesis/main.pdf), Vazou 2016 (One encouraging aspect of programming language theory is how [SMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories) solvers and [dependent typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type) are gradually making progress and enabling languages of the future to express and prove many invariants and properties about code. It's true that maybe you don't want to do full-blown theorem proving on a random script or IO processing program, but it's good for everyone that libraries and infrastructure can be easily locked down and rendered extremely reliable. The larger our systems get, the more important it is that the foundations not be buggy.)

## Film/TV

Live-action:

- [_A Beautiful Planet_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Planet) (saw in the Smithsonian Air & Space Museum: glorious long shots panning over the Earth from the ISS presented in IMAX 3D. Wallpapers cannot compare, and 3D for once serves its purpose of creating presence & making one feel like one is in the cramped submarine-like confines of the ISS. The ISS unavoidably feels fake in normal photos and videos, but taking a 3D camera-rig's perspective and floating slowly through the ISS modules or on spacewalks, I finally felt like it was a real place. The biggest flaw is the narration by Jennifer Lawrence, who in attempting gravitas, comes off as almost histrionic & incomprehensible due to sheer levels of obnoxious [vocal fry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_fry_register).)
- [_Florence Foster Jenkins_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Foster_Jenkins_\(film\)) (A very improbable-sounding plot, but it works and is moving, offering rewards beyond cringe-humor and the usual watching Hollywood recreate the 1940s. I checked WP on [the original person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Foster_Jenkins), and was amazed how close the film hews to history and how few & reasonable liberties it took with events.)
- [_The Sound of Music_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_of_Music_\(film\))
- [_Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them_\(film\))
- [_Going Clear_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_Clear_\(film\)) (Scientology expose; one can learn much more about Scientology online reading articles like ["The Apostate: Paul Haggis vs. the Church of Scientology"](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/02/14/the-apostate-lawrence-wright), and this documentary is no substitute for them or for books like _Bare-Faced Messiah: A Biography of L. Ron Hubbard_, but benefits from the use of archival footage - it definitely adds something to see footage of Hubbard himself and especially David Miscavige, to put faces & voices to the quotes & facts)

Animated:

- [_Finding Dory_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finding_Dory)
