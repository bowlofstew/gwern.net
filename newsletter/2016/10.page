Politics/religion:

- ["The Long-Term Effects of Cash Assistance"](https://web.stanford.edu/~djprice/papers/djprice_jmp.pdf), Price & Song 2016 (A very unusually long-term followup to one of the old American basic income experiments. No large harmful effects... but no large benefits either, nothing remotely like we observe in the Third World BI/transfer experiments. And if money helps with social outcomes, it should've helped more in the 1970s than it does now, so I feel more pessimistic about Give Directly/YC's USA BI experiment.)

Statistics/meta-science/mathematics:

- ["Active Learning Literature Survey"](http://burrsettles.com/pub/settles.activelearning.pdf), Settles 2010

    You can see this as a way to most economically increase your dataset size by only labeling the most valuable instances; it can also be used to improve dataset quality by targeting instead the errors a model makes on a noisy corpus for examination by the oracle; and finally, it can be seen as a demonstration of the advantages of reinforcement learning over simple supervised learning over heaps of data - given the curse of dimensionality, most data is useless for training a model because it is so redundant and already a solved problem, and the data the model needs to improve its performance is a needle in a haystack. So by giving a model RL capabilities, you improve its supervised/inference performance! The way I put this: "tool AIs want to be agent AIs".
