(Population genetics rule: rare variants are more harmful than common variants; and 1 harmful mutation, 1 reproductive death to purge it from the population.) Very cool application of genetics.)

Politics/religion:

- ["Wealth, Health, and Child Development: Evidence from Administrative Data on Swedish Lottery Players"](http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/131/2/687.full), Cesarini et al 2016
- ["Okhrana: The Paris Operations of the Russian Imperial Police"](https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/okhrana-the-paris-operations-of-the-russian-imperial-police/5474-1.html) (The back and forth secret war of the Okhrana with the myriads of Russian revolutionaries across Europe, documented by the complete archives of the Paris Okhrana office smuggled to America after the Russian Revolution. When you see how easily and thoroughly the Okhrana had infiltrated the Russian revolutionaries, you start to see why the Communist leadership would be extraordinarily paranoid about spies - but also that the revolutionaries were, well before the Revolution, generally highly nasty folks; many of the mentioned revolutionaries would be summarily executed by their comrades.)
- ["The Unbelievable Tale of Jesus's Wife"](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/07/the-unbelievable-tale-of-jesus-wife/485573/), [King's response](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/karen-king-responds-to-the-unbelievable-tale-of-jesus-wife/487484/) (_The Gospel of Jesus's Wife_ is probably a modern forgery. But it gets weirder. And kinkier. Forgeries like this always raise troubling issues about religious scriptures: if this forgery had been kept in private collections for another century before becoming known, in all likelihood, most of the damning evidence would either have disappeared or become inaccessible, and all that would be left is a few worries over the appearance. Most scriptures have even more vexed provenances than does the Gospel of Jesus's Wife, with blackouts of centuries not uncommon, and known destruction of variants (eg the well-known destruction of all variants of the Koran). Of course, you might think, who would dare counterfeit the Word of God Himself? Yet, humans are strange and inscrutable and can talk themselves into anything - why did Fritz do it? Probably even he doesn't really know. Who knows how many Fritzes there have been throughout history...)

- ["Statistically Controlling for Confounding Constructs Is Harder than You Think"](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152719), Westfall & Yarkoni 2016 (This is part of why results in sociology/epidemiology/psychology are so unreliable: not only do they usually not control for genetics at all, they don't even control for the things they think they control for. You have *not* controlled for SES by throwing in a discretized income variable measured in one year plus a discretized college degree variable. Variables which correlate with or predict some outcome such as poverty, may be doing no more than correcting some measurement error (frequently, due to the heavy genetic loading of most outcomes, correcting the omission of genetic information). This is why within-family designs are desirable even without worries about genetics: they hold constant shared-environment factors so you don't need to measure or model them.)
- ["Linear Programming: How Does It Work?"](http://jadagul.tumblr.com/post/145201618713/linear-programming-how-does-it-work)

Psychology/biology:

- ["Ann Roe's scientists: original published papers"](https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2016/06/roes-scientists-original-published.html) (One of the very few data sets, excluding TIP/SMPY, of extremely intelligent people. I am still reading through them but one impression I get is that the education system in America when most of them were growing up around 1910-1920 was grossly inadequate and unchallenging; many of them seem to only drift into their field when they happen to run into a challenging course in college. Quite a few mention incredibly little access to books and severe poverty (although interestingly, they all come from what are clearly middle/upper-class descent families, even if in some cases they are so poor as to be unable to afford shoes). Smart kids are so much better off these days with Internet access to anything at all they want to read. As I've noted in reading biographies of American scientists, the academic environment pre- and post-WWII is strikingly different than the pressure-cooker race to the bottom we are familiar with now. Relative underperformance in grades compared to females is also a running theme. With the chemists and physicists, home chemistry kits seem to have been nigh universal - which is something that sure doesn't happen these days!)
- ["Gifted Today But Not Tomorrow? Longitudinal Changes in Ability and Achievement in Elementary School"](http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ746292.pdf), Lohman & Korb 2006 (Challenges in gifted education in elementary or earlier: IQ scores are unstable and so regression to the mean implies that few children in G&T programs will grow up to be gifted.)
- ["Is Education Associated With Improvements in General Cognitive Ability, or in Specific Skills?"](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/dev/51/5/573.html), Ritchie et al 2015
- ["Understanding the Improvement in Disability Free Life Expectancy In the U.S. Elderly Population"](https://www.nber.org/papers/w22306.pdf), Chernew et al 2016 (Adult disability-free life expectancy continues to increase, due in large part to eye surgery improvements; vision is probably, like falling, the proximate cause of a lot of health issues.)
- ["Nicotine Contents in Some Commonly Used Toothpastes and Toothpowders: A Present Scenario"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3263647/), Agrawal & Ray 2012 (/not sure if harmful or helpful)

    - [Visual snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow): when you see the world slightly fuzzy and noisily, like very gentle translucent static on a TV screen
    - [Closed-eye hallucination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-eye_hallucination) with [phospenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphene): when you close your eyes and see a colored background with blobs and lights, especially in a pitch-black room or at night

## Books

Nonfiction:

- [_The Sports Gene_](http://thesportsgene.com/), Epstein
- [_Genius Revisited: High IQ Children Grown Up_](https://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/1993-subotnik-geniusrevisited.pdf), Subotnik et al 1993 ([review](https://www.gwern.net/Statistical%20notes#genius-revisited-on-the-value-of-high-iq-elementary-schools))

## Film/TV

Live-action:

- [_Bridge of Spies_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_of_Spies_(film)) (overly earnest - painfully and ironically so given the War on Terror - Cold War Spielberg film about a lawyer defending a spy; becomes much better and tense when the primary plot begins and [Donovan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_B._Donovan) must carefully play off the East Germans and Soviets while not blowing the whole deal. Standard Hollywood polish, perhaps a bit too heavy on the deliberate symbolism like the cold passed from Abel to Donovan onwards or the train/fence pairings and the contrast between the film implying Abel would be treated as a traitor by the USSR compared to Powers, which was the departure from history I found most objectionable.)

Anime:

- [_Basilisk_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilisk_(manga)) ([review](http://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=221630))
- [_Tonari no Seki-kun_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Neighbor_Seki) (Situational comedy: the straight (wo)man tries to avoid the distraction of her seat-mate but often winds up in trouble or missing lesson information, although other times she becomes drawn in and scores moral victories. Simple yet entertaining - the gags are varied and it's a fun light watch, especially since each episode is like 8 minutes so the premises don't wear themselves out. An excellent and well worth watching summary is the AMV ["My Neighbor Figaro Kun"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgoSJRt0Cuc) which, in the great foot-steps of _Bugs Bunny_, demonstrates why _The Barber of Seville_ is the best opera. To the extent there is any larger meaning of _Tonari no Seki-kun_, it struck me around episode 20 that the mute Seki-kun is something of a gifted child, trapped in a worthless conventional classroom learning stuff which no one cares about and all the students will forget as soon as possible, and that only Seki-kun is awake, as he works on his self-directed projects and learns far more than any school would teach him. Notes: whoever animated the cat episode clearly is not a cat owner; Seki-kun pulled off the magic trick by having *another* ace and crumpling a spare card to replace the original crumpled ace.)
