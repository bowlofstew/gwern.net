This is the November 2016 edition of [the `gwern.net` newsletter](https://gwern.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=ed1f6b2799208b40f5f18be8f&id=91b4d51355); previous, [October 2016](https://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2016/10) ([archives](https://www.gwern.net/tags/newsletter)).
This is a summary of the revision-history RSS feed, overlapping with my [Changelog](https://gwern.net/Changelog) & [Google+](https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968); brought to you by my donors on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/gwern).

If you prefer to subscribe as an RSS feed, you may be interested in the new service ["Kill the newsletter"](https://www.kill-the-newsletter.com/).

The December issue will likely be late as I am traveling most of that month: I will be in Oxford, England 11-22 December for the Cambridge Conference on Catastrophic Risk (12-14 December) and FHI workshop on AI Safety and Blockchain (16-17 December), and in London 24-25 December.

The main net is a little NN which chooses a couple out of a few thousand other NNs to do the real computation. Because only a couple subnets are activated at any time and the others are silent, they are effectively small specialized NNs - which accordingly fit in the GPU and are very fast forwards/backwards. Instead of the complications of learning to use an external memory, huge datasets can effectively be sharded & memorized by individual specialized sub NNs.)

## Film/TV

Live-action:

- [_Doctor Strange_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Strange_\(film\)) (Marvel action movie featuring Benedict Cumberbatch. Cumberbatch is always great fun to watch be superior to other people. Much of the plot is fairly perfunctory like the standard kung-fu-training-in-Tibet + Hollywood Buddhism trope, and the real fun is not the awkward martial arts but the space-warping mechanic employed in most of the fighting: it is a fascinating special effect, used much more extensively than the 'city warping' in _Inception_, and I really enjoyed watching those scenes. The finale offers an equally memorable use of a time-rewinding effect and a nice if somewhat simple resolution using time loops. Oddly, _Arrival_ also relies on time loops for its resolution, so both movies I watched in November used that plot device. _Doctor Strange_ doesn't take time manipulation to nearly the heights of _Braid_ or _Primer_, and only stands out in memory for the cityscape warping, but I was able to enjoy the movie for what it was.)
- [_Arrival_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrival_\(film\)) (see my review of [_Stories of Your Life and Others_](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/369923171))
