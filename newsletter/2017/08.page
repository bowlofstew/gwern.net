- ["Chronotype variation drives night-time sentinel-like behaviour in hunter-gatherers"](https://www.gwern.net/docs/melatonin/2017-samson.pdf), Samson et al 2017 (This could also explain why there is a wrenching shift in circadian rhythms towards inefficient later night-wakefulness during puberty and then only gradually shifts back to day-wakefulness with increasing age: this is the same time at which males become useful warriors and females start having offspring which must be minded. It becomes a stable equilibrium due to any defectors having an advantage in attacking rival tribes - anthropologists have long noted that ambushes & night raids are much preferred to open battle in the day.)
- ["Lower school performance in late chronotypes: underlying factors and mechanisms"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-04076-y), Zerbini et al 2017
- ["Multiplying 10-digit numbers using Flickr: The power of recognition memory"](http://people.csail.mit.edu/andyd/rec_method.pdf), Drucker 2010

Technology:

- [DCoins: a malicious ICO for DDOsing Ethereum (~\$3.5m/week)]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6iw2c8/how_to_attack_the_ethereum_network_using_a/ "How to attack the Ethereum network using a malicious ICO | A malicious smart contract could congest the network to unusable levels for upwards of seven days.") (A simple game-theory mechanism to incentivize spamming the Ethereum network: a contract which pays out decreasing amounts to only low-fee transactions. Since rejected transactions cost nothing, it becomes dominant for everyone to send in a withdrawal as often and early as possible...)
- ["7.2.1.7: History of Combinatorial Generation"](http://www.antiquark.com/blogimg/fasc4b.pdf), Knuth (reviews the long and error-prone history of combinatorial generation of sequences/permutations.)
