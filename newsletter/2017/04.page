Recent evolution:

- ["Soft sweeps are the dominant mode of adaptation in the human genome"](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/27/090084), Schrider & Kern 2017 (Detection of 2000 instances of recent human selection, half of which are specific to individual human populations, and many of which affect the central nervous system. Note this doesn't cover polygenic selection, so it's a very loose lower bound on how much recent human evolution there has been.)
- ["Comparative Genomic Evidence For Self-Domestication In Homo sapiens"](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/09/125799), Theofanopoulou et al 2017 (gene-culture co-evolution in selection for cognitive traits involved in domestication?)

AI:

- ["Recurrent Environment Simulators"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02254), Chiappa et al 2017 (towards deep model-based planning; [related discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/66x02v/d_rl_gans_as_mcts_environment_simulator_for_deep/ "[D] RL: GANs as MCTS environment simulator for deep model-based planning?"))
- ["Using Human Brain Activity to Guide Machine Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05463), Fong et al 2017

    If I'm understanding this right, it can be seen as related to Hinton's 'dark knowledge' and knowledge distillation in NNs: you use a teacher NN to provide additional supervision on the image classification problem by indicating hard & easy examples and also what is the 'right' probability to assign to all the wrong classifications in order to refine the loss function. In this case, the SVM is guided by the human brain fMRI activations which indicate which instances are hard/easy and so which ones it should concentrate on (an error on a hard instance should lead to smaller adjustments than an error on an easy one). This sort of supervision could be quite interesting if you think about its use for AI risk problems - moral dilemmas, for example.
- ["In-Datacenter Performance Analysis of A Tensor Processing Unit [TPU]"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx4hafXDDq2EMzRNcy1vSUxtcEk/view), Jouppi et al 2017 (the nitty-gritty on what Google's TPUs can and cannot do)

- ["Artist Agent: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Automatic Stroke Generation in Oriental Ink Painting"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4634), Xie et al 2012 (RL is good for art experiments like this because many artistic criteria tend to be 'global' and non-differentiable or local - RMSE on pixels is not a good criterion.)

- [_DNA Dreams_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dVv5RMwzuo) (short 2013 documentary on Beijing Genomics Institute and the research on IQ; the results still haven't come out, having been pre-empted by Rietveld et al 2013 finding the first IQ hits, subsequent GWASes' demonstration that the BGI bet on rare variants was wrong, and reportedly internal BGI disarray due to a disastrous bet on in-house development of DNA sequencers to try to break free of the Illumina sequencer quasi-monopoly; the documentary is fatally compromised by any actual discussion of genetics, instead settling for occasional ominous music, wandering BGI's admittedly impressive facilities, and occasional idiosyncratic scenes of dating or family life)
