    The details on NK use of digital censorship is interesting: steady progress in locking down Bluetooth and WiFi by software and then hardware modifications; use of Android security system/DRM to install audit log + regular screenshots to capture foreign media consumption; a whitelist/signed-media system to block foreign media from ever being viewed, with auto-deletion of offending files; watermarking (courtesy of an American university's misguided outreach) of media created on desktops to trace them; network blocking and surveillance; and efforts towards automatic bulk surveillance of text messages for 'South-Korean-style' phrases/words. Stallman's warnings about DRM are quite prophetic in the NK context - the system is secured against the *user*...

- [_Breaking Bad_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad):
In retrospect, I'm surprised I took so long to watch this - after the arrest of Ross Ulbricht, a white man who was a materials science graduate student before dropping to try being an entrepreneur and then launching Silk Road 1 & becoming a drug kingpin who ordered 2 hits, the _Breaking Bad_ jokes were endless and a later darknet market even tried theming itself based on BB. I'm glad I finally did, despite the intimidating length: BB is indeed awesome.
The first episode is a masterful cinematic depiction of what I could only consider at the time Trumpism and 'elite overproduction': our protagonist Walter White, squeezed out of research at a national laboratory (as a plaque on the wall commemorating the creation of a new element tells us), underemployed as a high school chemistry teacher, is systematically degraded by everyone he meets, from the arrogant immigrant to the rich children of connected insiders to even his wife (who pays more attention to her eBay auction than giving him a handjob).
BB forms a dark counterpoint to that other great sprawling American TV series on drugs & crime, _The Wire_.
Where _The Wire_ is a quasi-Marxist examination of how the interlocking systems of power in an American society undermine any attempt to do good by the well-intentioned & usually inherently good people by adding friction to the good choices & posing coordination problems, BB is a more person-centric character drama emphasizing the irreducible choice that goes into social pathology: it's not "society's fault" - while bad things do happen, everybody always has choices, there is always a path to the good outcome, and it is almost never the case that someone is truly forced into drug dealing or armed robbery or fraud rather than starve to death. The subsistence wage in the USA is far above starvation, and this is because people demand certain things, certain standards of living, which give them pride, and they will kill or die rather than live below it.
BB is an extended examination of pride as a deadly sin - indeed, *the* deadly sin, occupying pride of place in the standard list of the 7 deadly sins, and identified as the first sin, Lucifer's.
Why is pride so terrible and a mortal sin, when it seems so much more harmless than the others like wrath or gluttony or envy?
Perhaps because it has no limits - there will never be enough money, enough drugs, or enough power for White - and its inherent nature is to be incorrigible: White can never truly listen to others, trust in them, accept their help, or change his mind.
(Here the parallels to Ross Ulbricht are striking, as Ulbricht too, in his journal entries, plans for Silk Road 1 expansions, and growing comfort with ordering his, evinced a loss of perspective and a growing hubris leading him to ignore clanging alarm bells and indulge in disastrous security practices - some apparently motivated by the idea of writing a self-congratulatory autobiography! - that led nowhere but to a life sentence.)
The slothful or wrathful can acknowledge their flaws and hope to do better, and even the lustful & greedy & envious can be briefly satisfied or rest from their sins.
But the prideful know no respite: long as White is alive, he loves no one, can take satisfaction in nothing, and must blame anyone other than himself for his self-inflicted failures as a researcher/businessman, husband, father, and drug dealer.
There is no need for the viewer to condemn Walter White: he is already in Hell.
