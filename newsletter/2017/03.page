This is a summary of the revision-history RSS feed, overlapping with my [Changelog](https://gwern.net/Changelog) & [Google+](https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968); brought to you by my donors on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/gwern).

# Writings

- `gwern.net`: HTTPS now mandatory; HTML sections rewritten using HTML5 semantic markup for hopefully better compatibility with screen readers & offline browsers like Pocket/ReadItLater; "importance" metadata added to all pages to rank them; "belief" metadata renamed more intuitively as "confidence"; finish adding 301 Redirects for all broken links & common typos; renamed & all darknet market pages for current terminology; rewrote Patreon profile

    The details on NK use of digital censorship is interesting: steady progress in locking down Bluetooth and WiFi by software and then hardware modifications; use of Android security system/DRM to install audit log + regular screenshots to capture foreign media consumption; a whitelist/signed-media system to block foreign media from ever being viewed, with auto-deletion of offending files; watermarking (courtesy of an American university's misguided outreach) of media created on desktops to trace them; network blocking and surveillance; and efforts towards automatic bulk surveillance of text messages for 'South-Korean-style' phrases/words. Stallman's warnings about DRM are quite prophetic in the NK context - the system is secured against the *user*...
