# Writings

- ["'Story Of Your Life' Is Not A Time-Travel Story"](https://www.gwern.net/Story%20Of%20Your%20Life "Famous Ted Chiang SF short story 'Story Of Your Life' is usually misinterpreted as, like the movie version, being about time-travel/precognition; I explain it is instead an exploration of the psychology of timeless physics interpretations.")

## Film/TV

Live-action:

- _[Once Upon A Time In The West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_in_the_West)_ (a strikingly spare Western; the opening scene is a memorable set piece, the atmosphere is closer to that of a film noir in its refusal to explain even to the end, and Henry Fonda makes a remarkable villain with a odd homoerotically sadistic relationship with his railroad patron)
