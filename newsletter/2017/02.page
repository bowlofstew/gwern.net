# Writings

- ["'Story Of Your Life' Is Not A Time-Travel Story"](https://www.gwern.net/Story%20Of%20Your%20Life "Famous Ted Chiang SF short story 'Story Of Your Life' is usually misinterpreted as, like the movie version, being about time-travel/precognition; I explain it is instead an exploration of the psychology of timeless physics interpretations.")
