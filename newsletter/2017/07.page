This illustrates a good way to work around the shortage of high-quality IQ test scores by exploiting multiple more easily-measured phenotypes. Even better: like LD score regression, MTAG only requires public summary statistics; so it may also, like LD score regression, see an explosion in use - since it is usable by everyone & there are so many overlapping phenotypic measurements...)

## Film/TV

Live-action:

- [_Dunkirk_ (2017)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkirk_\(2017_film\)) (an aggressive mish-mash of action scenes with one of the most excessive Hollywood soundtrack, exhaustingly droning & pounding throughout the movie, I've ever heard. The special effects in the action scenes are, as usual, perfect, but oddly compromised by a lack of scale - while Dunkirk involved hundreds of thousands of men, somehow the effects conspire to create not a sense of catastrophe & crisis but a sense of conspicuous crampedness, as if only a few hundred men and a few dozen boats were ever involved rather than entire armies. The gritty and horrifying set pieces depicted with such cinematographic care ought to add up to more than they do.)

Animated:
