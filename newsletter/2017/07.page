This illustrates a good way to work around the shortage of high-quality IQ test scores by exploiting multiple more easily-measured phenotypes. Even better: like LD score regression, MTAG only requires public summary statistics; so it may also, like LD score regression, see an explosion in use - since it is usable by everyone & there are so many overlapping phenotypic measurements...)

## Film/TV

Live-action:

- [_Dunkirk_ (2017)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkirk_\(2017_film\)) (an aggressive mish-mash of action scenes with one of the most excessive Hollywood soundtrack, exhaustingly droning & thudding throughout the movie, I've ever heard. The special effects in the action scenes are, as usual, perfect, but oddly compromised by a lack of scale - while Dunkirk involved hundreds of thousands of men, somehow the effects conspire to create not a sense of catastrophe & crisis but a sense of conspicuous crampedness, as if only a few hundred men and a few dozen boats were ever involved rather than entire armies. The gritty & horrifying set pieces depicted with such cinematographic care ought to add up to more than they do.)

## Games

- [_Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_Wars_3:_Dimensions) (purchased after a Linux upgrade killed my copy of [_GridWars 2_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GridWars); GW2 had entranced me after reading [World of Stuart's review](http://worldofstuart.excellentcontent.com/grid/wars.htm "The Frequency's My Universe: Love on a farm boy's wages") and being intrigued by the described strategic gameplay of black hole farming. After some experimentation, I discovered that the control combination of a mouse for movement and the d-pad for firing offered me an extraordinary level of laser-sharp eyeblink-fast control which unlocked the higher reaches of black hole farming, allowing for intense trance-inducing games lasting up to my high score of 35m30s/2,945,963 points. Naturally I assumed as a 'clone' that GW2's mouse-keyboard control scheme was drawn from the original _Geometry Wars_. Alas! GW3, despite many years of development, offers naught but the twin-sticks Xbox gamepad and a clumsy keyboard-only control scheme. Playing even the simplest level of GW3 feels like wading through mud - after being anesthetized. Going back would be as difficult as using a push lawn mower after a z-track riding lawn mower, a HDD after an SSD, a mouse after a trackball... GW3 boasts many levels and modes, but I fear they all must be enjoyed through the same control scheme. If I had not played GW2, perhaps I could appreciate GW3 for what it is, but I have been spoiled. I will simply have to figure out how to get GW2 running again, in a VM if I must.)
