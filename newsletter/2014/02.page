Welcome to the February edition of the `gwern.net` ML; the previous was [January](http://eepurl.com/NzHiD).

The purpose of this mailing list is to be a summarized version of the site RSS feed (which lists every patch), overlapping with my [Changelog page](https://gwern.net/Changelog), but in a push/notification medium rather than pull. It includes material from [my Google+](https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968) & the [LW media threads](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/tag/media_thread/).

- [Fully Decentralized Bitcoin Prediction Markets](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ycjdi/whitepaper_decentralized_bitcoin_prediction/):

     On-blockchain transactions. The key idea is how judgment of a prediction market is carried out: holders of 'truthcoins' submit encrypted votes 1/0 on every outstanding market, and rather than a simple majority vote, they're weighted by how well they mirror the overall consensus and paid out a share of trading fees based on that weight. This punishes deviation from the majority and reminds me of Bayesian truth serum. Very clever. I haven't been too impressed with the Bitcoin betting sites I've seen too far (some of them like Bets of Bitcoin are just atrocious), but this seems like a fully decentralized design. The problem is it's so complex that I don't see anyone implementing it anytime soon.

## Books

Fiction:

- _Absolute [Sandman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_%28Vertigo%29)_, vol III-IV
- [_Radiance_](https://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-radiance) ([review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/370154318))
- Brosh 2013's _Hyperbole and a Half_ ([review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/859555507))

## Film/TV

Film:

- [_All Is Lost_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Is_Lost): if the WP description of a 1.5 hour dialogue-less film about a small-boat disaster & survival sounds like something you'd enjoy, you probably will; Redford does an excellent job and it is interesting to watch his character think & improvise and try to master the situations he finds himself in
- [_The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Best_Exotic_Marigold_Hotel): not nearly as awful and sentimental tripe as one would expect given the setting of a retirement home in India, and particularly interesting for depicting some of the struggles elderly people experience these days (not something I see much of).
