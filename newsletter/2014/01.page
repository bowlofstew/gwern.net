Welcome to the January edition of the `gwern.net` mailing list; the previous edition was [December](http://eepurl.com/LG6OT). If you do not want to receive these monthly emails, there is an unsubscribe link at the bottom.

The purpose of this mailing list is to be a summarized version of the site RSS feed (which lists every patch, no matter how small), overlapping with my [Changelog page](https://gwern.net/Changelog), but in a push/notification medium rather than pull. It also includes material from [my Google+](https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968) & the [LW media threads](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/tag/media_thread/).
