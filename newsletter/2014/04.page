- ["Preparing for the Possibility of a North Korean Collapse"](http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR300/RR331/RAND_RR331.pdf), Bennett 2013 (A fascinating read. I didn't know many of those details about how the East German collapse was able to go so smoothly, or that Kim Jong-Il had intimidated his subordinates during the '90s famines with footage of impoverished humiliated East German elites.)

If you get an actual biomarker for aging, it'll revolutionize anti-aging studies by letting you test interventions in a decade with a small fraction of the humans you'd need with mortality-based methods. Right now, it takes decades and sample sizes of thousands or tens of thousands of people to show a reduction in all-cause mortality - a highly-precise anti-aging marker would change all that.﻿)

## Film/TV

Animation:

- [_Madoka: Rebellion_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puella_Magi_Madoka_Magica:_The_Movie#Rebellion) (a must-watch for anyone who enjoyed the TV series; I am not certain in general what to make of it, and need to rewatch it. If you're going to watch it at all, I recommend avoiding spoilers.)
- [_Ayakashi_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayakashi:_Samurai_Horror_Tales) (3-part anthology; skip the truly wretched first part, watch the second if you have time for a mildly-interesting metafictional kabuki play, and enjoy the third part which started [_Mononoke_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mononoke_%28TV_series%29))
- _Frozen_ (unobjectionable for a Disney movie although not without flaws - slangy dialogue will date it fast, plot made characters unnecessarily evil, snowman was the most hateful character since Jar Jar Binks)
