Powder City ZMA: 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 March 2017
capped 216 (24x9 batches) ZMA pills; capped 240 flour; 2h total capping & cleanup
ZMA powder, like magnesium citrate powder, is a pain to cap because it is a fluffy sticky powder which eventually starts to jam the pill machine, requiring it to be washed and thoroughly dried before doing a second batch
~3x1cc scoops per pill
starting point: 2x100g Powder City ZMA Powder packages; bought 13 March 2017 during going-out-of-business sale for total $19.27
suggested dose: ~2.5g/day, so 200/2.5=80 doses, or $0.24 per dose
contents:
- Vitamin B6 as Pyridoxine Hydrochloride: 10.5mg
- Magnesium as aspartate: 250mg
- Zinc as mono-l-methionine and aspartate: 30mg

I used ZMA on 6 nights before capping, at ~3 scoops per night, so had left 200 - (6*2.5) = 185g of ZMA powder

185g/216 pills = ~0.86g/pill, requiring 3 pills to reach a dose of ~2.57g
so at 3 pills per night, 72 nights of ZMA
