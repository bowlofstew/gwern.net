# 2015
## Background

In June 2015, I began developing a modafinil survey; I wanted a better picture of modafinil users, particularly the intercept rates and potential genetic moderator. After some months of occasional work and some feedback from ModafinilCat, who had also volunteered to offer a prize when I mentioned the draft, I [finished the 2015 survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ZNyGHl6vnHD62spZyHIqyvNM_Ts_82GvZQVdAr2LrGs/viewform) on 26 September 2015, leaving it open for a month, and posting notifications to a variety of places online:

- my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gwern/status/647820940945043457) & [Google+](https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968/posts/RAEu6MKyuaY)

- [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10283720)
- [LW](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/mt2/link_2015_modafinil_user_survey/)
- [Longecity](http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/81946-2015-modafinil-user-survey/)
- ModafinilCat mailing list

The community response was enthusiastic. People pointed out in comments & the feedback part of the form issues with the survey which will hopefully be fixed for next year.

## Data

I closed the survey ~1:10PM 2015-10-27, having gotten 3835 responses which pass QA. (My hope was to get <=1k responses, which makes this a big success.)

The data:

- [archive of how the survey looked & question wording](/docs/modafinil/survey/2015-10-27-modafinil-questions.maff)
- [raw data](/docs/modafinil/survey/2015-10-27-modafinilsurvey.csv) (deleted the email/address question for privacy, redacted a few of the feedback entries which included real names/addresses)
- [the user free-response/feedback](/docs/modafinil/survey/2015-10-27-modafinilsurvey-feedback.csv)

### Results
#### Demographics

1. Gender: 89% male, 11% female (interestingly, this is almost identical to the [arrest percentages for the darknet markets](https://www.gwern.net/DNM%20arrests))
2. Age: mean of 29 and most are in their 20s-early-30s, but there's a wide spread of ages past that, with respondents claiming to be as young as 16 to as old as 81. Histogram: https://i.imgur.com/WunTGiP.png
3. Country: unsurprisingly given the websites involved, survey results are dominated by respondents from (in descending order), the USA (56%), Australia (18%), UK (11%), Canada (2%), France (1%), Germany (1%), Netherlands (0.8%), Singapore (0.7%), Poland (0.36%), Ireland (0.33%), and Thailand (0.33%), with a scattering of other countries.
4. Ethnicity/race: predictable from the country data - 77% non-Hispanic whites, 9% East Asians, the rest fairly evenly distributed across South Asians, blacks, Hispanics, Middle Eastern, etc.
4. Income: the median response is quite high, around \$45k (so somewhat above the annual US per-capita median income), mean=\$65k, but also with plenty of low earners, a fair number of people reporting zero income (presumably students or unemployed), and a few very high earners claiming as high as \$6m; this sort of skewing is common in income data, though, and the histogram of the log of reported income looks right, so the high incomes may be accurate.
4. Job: the income data is striking given that 'student' is the most commonly reported occupation, and reported mean incomes do differ by work status:

    - Student:                          34.31% (\$18,767)
    - For-profit work (private sector): 31.01% (\$83,969)
    - Self-employed:                    15.75% (\$91,616)
    - Academic:                          4.08% (\$54,995)
    - Government work:                   3.01% (\$67,813)
    - Non-profit work:                   1.86% (\$77,422)
    - Unemployed:                        1.96% (\$19,212)

    So we see there is some truth to the stereotype that modafinil is used mostly by students and professionals - between those two categories, that's easily 80%. There is much less academia than expected, though.
5. Education: I'll break this down by level:

    - High school:                      18.23%
    - Associate's degree:               10.94%
    - Bachelor's:                       48.46%
    - Masters:                          13.66%
    - Professional degree (MD/JD/etc):   4.53%
    - PhD:                               4.18%

    So 82% of respondents have some sort of higher education.

#### Usage
##### Experiences

- Modafinil is the most popular of the 3 main -afinils, at 78%; followed by armodafinil at 19% and adrafinil at a bare 4%.

    Interestingly, many modafinil users have given armodafinil a try as well; about half of those who prefer modafinil have used armodafinil at least once. I wonder if this is related to the longer halflife of the armodafinil isomer? (~2% have ever tried hydrafinil.)
- Generic vs name-brand is sometimes invoked to explain issues like rashes or no effect. Most respondents (65%) cannot compare them, but of the ones who can, there is no consensus about what the difference is - 60% say they seem about the same, with the remainder evenly split between better/worse.

###### Genetics
####### Bodenmann et al 2009 nonreplication

["Pharmacogenetics of modafinil after sleep loss: catechol-O-methyltransferase genotype modulates waking functions but not recovery sleep", Bodenmann et al 2009](http://www.pharma.uzh.ch/research/chronobiology/areas/psychopharmacology/publications/Bodenmann_2009_ClinPharmacolTher85.pdf) found that of n=22 subjects, the ones with Val/Val (GG) on the SNP Rs4680 had considerably better subjective experiences during sleep deprivation, while efficacy in Met/Met (AA) across various measures was much smaller and sometimes nonexistent.
This is most intriguing as the effect sizes are large enough that Rs4680 could explain why people can differ so much in what they think the effect of modafinil on themselves is, and could potentially be useful in guiding decisions to try out modafinil given that SNP data like offered by 23andMe can be purchased for \$100-\$200 (ie the size of many single orders or copays for modafinil).
The problem is that this is a candidate-gene experiment, whose results can reach statistical-significance only because they study a single SNP rather than all available SNPs (which would be a GWAS); candidate-gene studies have a fairly notorious reputation for results not replicating and followup GWAS studies showing that dozens or hundreds of candidate-gene results were bogus, and there have been no followups or replications of Bodenmann et al 2009.
Since 23andMe has over a million customers as of 2015, and many of the measures in Bodenmann et al 2009 were subjective, it should be possible to test the claim using a survey asking people for both Rs4680 status and their subjective appraisal of modafinil efficacy; if the effect is real and anywhere as strong as indicated, it should be absolutely clear with a few hundred survey results.

216 respondents included their Rs4680 status; the percentage were 26% AA / 42% AG / 32% GG, giving an almost exactly balanced number of AAs vs GGs, just as in the Bodenmann et al 2009 European sample.
[dbSNP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=4680) reports that of a general population of 1507 samples, the corresponding percentages were 12%/44%/43%

In regressing Rs4680 status on a sum of the 3 responses relating to subjective experience of modafinil (the 1-5 'how effective do you find modafinil', the binary 'would you say modafinil has changed your life', and the number of issues respondent indicated that modafinil helped with), the result is not statistically-significant and is in the opposite direction.
(This is true whether Rs4680 is regressed as a linear or categorical predictor, and whether the 3 responses are summed or used as separate dependent variables.)

One might think that sample selection accounts for the lack of effect, as people for whom modafinil does not work will be much less likely to participate in the survey; this selection effect predicts that there would be a large excess of GGs (for whom modafinil works well) and a corresponding lack of AAs (most of whom it does not work and will not bother to participate, leaving only the luckier AAs who think modafinil works for other reasons), large enough to make the effects disappear, but in comparing to the population frequencies we see not just insufficient imbalance to explain the lack of effect, but quite the *opposite* - there's an excess of AAs and a corresponding reduction in GGs.
(The excess of AAs compared to the dbSNP population frequencies may be due to racial differences, since respondents are mostly Caucasian or East Asian.)

<!-- TODO: remove Bodenmann et al 2009 from its prominent place in Modafinil.page; I no longer believe it -->

####### Placebo SNPs

I also asked about COMT Rs4570625 & COMT Rs4633, as they have been identified in a few interesting candidate-gene studies as possibly causing larger or smaller placebo effects; being able to adjust survey responses for placebo effects would be useful, and by explaining variation in responses might allow other relationships to emerge.
Unfortunately, regressing those two along with Rs4680 shows likewise non-statistically-significant results.

##### Purchasing behavior

[17] "How.many.times.have.you.purchased.modafinil."
[19] "How.many.units...doses.is.your.usual.order...0.10.tablets."
[20] "How.many.units...doses.is.your.usual.order...11.50."
[21] "How.many.units...doses.is.your.usual.order...51.100."
[22] "How.many.units...doses.is.your.usual.order...101.150."
[23] "How.many.units...doses.is.your.usual.order...151.200."
[24] "How.many.units...doses.is.your.usual.order...200.400."
[25] "How.many.units...doses.is.your.usual.order...400.."
[26] "How.much.does.your.usual.order.cost."
[27] "How.much.do.you.spend.annually.on..afinils."
[28] "Where.do.you.usually.buy."
[70] "If.clearnet..which.of.the.following.have.you.ever.used."

##### Risks
###### Side-effects, tolerance

- Tolerance: on a Likert going from 'as effective as first time' to 'Became completely ineffective':

    1. 22.61%
    2. 31.18%
    3. 33.82%
    4. 11.08%
    5. 1.31%

    So it seems most users (2-4=76%) would endorse some small to substantial amount of tolerance developing, but very few (many fewer than claim to notice no tolerance at all) would say the tolerance is total. (On the other hand, perhaps the tolerant drop modafinil usage and aren't answering the survey.)
- For those experiencing tolerance, it tends to set in fast, within weeks: the median is 2 weeks. (Consistent with placebo effect.)
- Where there is tolerance, one must worry there may also be dependency or addiction; I asked two questions aimed at this, a Likert 1-5 (5=bad) and a yes/no about if they could quit modafinil use immediately. For the former, 15% answered 4/5, above average, with 3% indicating 5 and dependency; in the yes/no, 6% chose 'no', they could not quit.
- A list of side-effects was provided. A graph of side-effects reported at least 3 times: https://i.imgur.com/iSJUUM9.png

    1. headaches: 1062
    1. smelly urine: 1053
    1. insomnia/difficulty falling asleep: 973
    1. anxiety/hyperventilation/fast heart rate: 637
    1. weight loss: 342
    1. rash or itches: 157
    1. abdominal pain: 156
    1. fever or cold or sore throat: 99
    1. sores or blisters: 52
    1. swelling face/lips/tongue/throat: 36
    1. dry mouth: 15
    1. nausea: 12
    1. diarrhea: 10
    1. loss of appetite: 8
    1. irritability: 5
    1. dehydration: 4
    1. high blood pressure: 4
    1. depression: 3
    1. thirst: 3

    I suspect the high frequency of headaches may be due to people not getting enough food & drink or not trying out smaller doses. Below a frequency of 3, there are a lot of free-response & idiosyncratic responses (eg "Massive black eyes from REM deprivation" or "I most times poop within an hour of taking it"), which you can read through [in the side-effects CSV](/docs/modafinil/survey/2015-10-27-survey-sideeffects.csv); no one reports [Stevens-Johnson Syndrome](!Wikipedia) (SJS), though.

## Improvements

- increase from 1 month to 2 months
- 'A "reason for stopping modafinil" if applicable question could yield some interesting insight.' <-- don't I have that on the stopped-page?
- '"If you experienced tolerance, how many weeks did it take to develop?" should be days' <-- is '1 week' common enough to switch to days?
- 'Might be worth adding emotional instability or moodiness as an option under side-effects.' <-- and aggressiveness, impatience, and irritability
- clarify dosage and frequency for each -afinil
- remove free-response entry on Gender because of abuse like 'meat popsicle'
- add a positivity constraint on this one to next survey: "How.much.does.your.usual.order.cost."
- add a <120 constraint on At.what.age.did.you.first.use.any..afinil. and Current.age; reduce lower bound to ~10 due to someone claiming they started at 14
- add a <600 constraint on Body.weight; loosen lower constraint to allow >60kg
- add a <24h constraint on Sleep.duration..on.an.average.night..how.many.hours.do.you.sleep.
- add a <1000 constraint on If.you.experienced.tolerance..how.many.weeks.did.it.take.to.develop. (modafinil has not been approved in the USA longer than that)
- add a >=0 constraint on How.many.times.have.your.orders.not.arrived.for.any.reason.
- How.did.you.hear.of.and.become.interested.in.modafinil.: add gwern.net, Dave Asprey/Bulletproof, unquote _Limitless_, drugsforum,bluelight, SlateStarCodex, Tim Ferriss, Doctor, LessWrong, Hacker News, Joe Rogan, IRC, Quora, NeoGAF, boldanddetermined.com
- remove commas from side-effects entry "Swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat"
- add clarifying help text to attention test question
- Country: add Netherlands, Singapore, Ireland, Thailand, India, Norway, Spain, Belgium, Hungary, Sweden, Malaysia, Mexico, Switzerland, Denmark, New Zealand, Philippines, Vietnam, China, Columbia, Czech Republic, Italy, Romania, South Korea, Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Croatia, Estonia, Hong Kong, Slovakia, South Africa

Analysis:

demographics: students vs professionals?
what kind of -afinil gets higher ratings?
does the original modafinil SNP replicate?
if we take the nootropic grid's scores, the placebo SNP data, and estimate a 'placebo factor', does this predict either tolerance or higher modafinil ratings?
does tolerance fit with close together use of modafinil to skip sleep? half-lives etc
what fraction of respondents report legal entanglements?

## 240 may sound improbable, but the 240 orders guy says he uses 1000mg daily, and spends $2800/annually at $240/order over the past 24 years (age 40-64),

## > I would prefer to use the ordinary capsule type amphetamines that were available in the 1960's and 1970's that were available in the U.S.A.
